# A Child's Phone Contract

My daughter is 10 and will soon be going to secondary school in the UK. The school is several miles away and she will be independently travel there and back every day. We thought a phone would be a sensible idea.

Emma and I both work in the technology industry. Whilst any parent's reaction is to shelter their child from the threats of exposure to the web, we both believe that by setting the right boundaries and guidelines, and giving our daughters the right tools, that technology is not the threat but people are. We will not restrict their access to technology. But we must insist they agree to guidelines on how they can keep safe. This is a start.

## Inspiration
Primary inspiration for this comes from [Cameron and the contract he wrote for his son fives years ago](https://medium.com/@cameronmoll/a-mobile-phone-contract-for-our-teenage-son-b89701e0df70), which was in turn inspired by [Janell Burley Hofmann](http://www.janellburleyhofmann.com/postjournal/gregorys-iphone-contract/#.XKtA8etKjOQ)
