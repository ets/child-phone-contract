# A Child's Phone Contract

## The four main rules

- This phone is primarily for your safety. Be responsible for knowing how to call for help and when.
- Keep your phone on you.
- We will always know your password and will check the browser history and messages from time to time. 
- Always answer and/or return messages or phone calls from Mum and Dad. 

## Using this phone

- If it rings, answer it. Be polite. Never hang up on someone.
- Treat it carefully and respectfully. If it breaks, you are responsible for its repair.
- The phone will go in the kitchen drawer one hour before bedtime every night and not come out until morning.
- You will keep it charged at all times.
- You understand you are responsible for knowing where your phone is at all times.
- No phones at the dinner table.
- Be in the moment, not in your phone. 
- Don't look at your phone and walk at the same time. You'll walk into a lamp-post or some dog poo. Your dad has done both. Learn from his stupidity.

## This phone and other people

- Do not text, email or say anything using this phone that you wouldn't say in person.
- Do not send threatening or mean messages to others.
- Follow your school rules on mobile phones.
- Do not lend your phone to anyone.
- Promise you will tell Mum and Dad when you receive suspicious phone calls from people you don't know.
- Do not send inappropriate photos of yourself or others to anyone else. If you see inappropriate images of anything or anyone else; delete them, close the tab, delete the app.
- Be careful about who you tell your phone number to.


## Using the web and apps

- The web is an amazing place. Use the web for things you would openly share with us. Practice safe, responsible digital behaviour.
- Wifi at home will be on and available between the hours of 8am and 7pm daily.
- Don't take millions of photographs and videos. They all have to be stored somewhere and that costs money. Better to keep it in your brain. Humans are designed to store more than a phone.
- Your personal email address is just that: personal. Be careful about who you share it with.

## Three strikes

- We will operate a three strikes and out policy. Any breach of this agreement will result in a warning. After three warnings, the phone will be removed and the contract terminated.
